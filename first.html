<p>The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".<u>In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις)</u>, which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to develop of their own accord.<br>The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion;it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.
